# An exploratory proof-of-concept implementation of a CSPRNG
# (cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator) using
# adversarially trained neural networks. The work was inspired by
# the findings of Abadi & Andersen, outlined in the paper
# "Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial
# Networks", available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06918.
#
# The original implementation by Abadi is available at
# https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/adversarial_crypto
